# iOSStarterProject
A common starter project for my future iOS projects.

The idea is to ensure that I get a running start for my projects. This means :
 - Add common frameworks created by others
 - Create my own minimalist libraries and use them in this project
 - Ensure that the startup path is as fast and correct w.r.t. the frameworks being used as possible
 - Add startup performance tests that act as a warning w.r.t. performance degradation
 
 TODO: Keep on improving.
